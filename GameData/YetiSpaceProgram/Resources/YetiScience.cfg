		default = You exposed the material samples to the environment, taking notes of how it behaves.

		SunFlyingLow = Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss.........

		MohoSrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
		MohoSrfLanded = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.

		KerbinSrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you silently.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated all the samples. We did learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment, though!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The water spray has rusted one of the samples and some of the electronics ar&/F***13e5rse4t8st######

		MinmusSrfLanded = While the material samples were processed, you began to turn your thoughts to how much Minmus looks like a mint dessert, and have discovered that you are now hungry.

		GillySrfLanded = The samples appear to behave like they're in low orbit of Kerbin.
		GillySrfLanded = Some of the surface material has mixed with the contents of the bay. You write down the results for good measure.

		DunaSrfLanded = The sample computer processes the results. It's massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly, ominously, blinks.

		IkeSrfLanded = One of the samples has reacted very strangely to the surface of Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = One of the crystal samples explodes and throws green shards out of the materials bay!

		DresSrfLanded = As the samples process, the computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works. Apparently the song is about a flower of some kind.
		DresSrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.

		JoolInSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly, however, when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.		
		JoolFlyingHigh = The intense, crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil, or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...

		LaytheFlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. Interestingly, the color indicates the presence of oxygen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine, particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample bay power supply begins to short out! Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!

		VallSrfLanded = Many of the samples either freeze or evaporate from the sample container.
		VallSrfLanded = The container sample door freezes up, before finally continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.

		TyloSrfLanded = One of the samples shatters into a fine mist when exposed to the surface of Tylo.
		
		BopSrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
		BopSrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.

		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!

		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the fine crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. It also appears that some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
