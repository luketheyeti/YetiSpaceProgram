	RESULTS
	{
		default = You exposed the material samples to the environment, taking notes of how it behaves.

		SunFlyingLow = Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss.........

		MohoSrfLanded = The materials bay bakes in the heat of Moho's surface. It appears that trace elements are reacting to the samples contained within.
		MohoSrfLanded = You expose the samples to the high temperatures of Moho. A lot of them melt in really interesting ways.

		KerbinSrfLanded = The materials show little signs of change, though one of the samples appears to be judging you silently.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated all the samples. We did learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment, though!
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The water spray has rusted one of the samples and some of the electronics ar&/F***13e5rse4t8st######
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has proved to be rather... enlightening.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry that it may have a bad influence on them.
		KerbinFlyingLow = The less resilient samples appear to have splattered around the interior, forming new and interesting color combinations.
		KerbinFlyingHigh = The rarified air has caused interesting changes to the gel samples. It seems like something is happening with the interior structure.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The micro gravity has greatly affected the growth of crystalline structures. Loose objects are also flying around the bay in a very messy but fascinating way.  

		MunSrfLanded = The fine dust of the Mun has intermixed with some of the samples. You have a sneaking suspicion that they'll never be able to get the lab clean again.
		MunSrfLanded = You leave the sample bay doors open on the Mun, and go do something else for a while.
		
		MinmusSrfLanded = While the material samples were processed, you began to turn your thoughts to how much Minmus looks like a mint dessert, and have discovered that you are now hungry.

		InSpace = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. It looks like it would be fun to paint the rocket with this.

		EveSrfLanded = The crushing pressure of the atmosphere is causing some of the materials to crystallize rapidly.
		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if most of the samples changed color, or if it's just the lighting...
		EveFlyingHigh = The extremely dense atmosphere strips the contents of the materials bay.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to either polish or strip the material, depending on its composition.

		GillySrfLanded = The samples appear to behave like they're in low orbit of Kerbin.
		GillySrfLanded = Some of the surface material has mixed with the contents of the bay. You write down the results for good measure.

		DunaSrfLanded = Opening the sample container you find that everything has turned red. Initial tests show that it'll never wash out of white space suits. You consider sending missions in pink EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		DunaSrfLanded = The sample computer processes the results. It's massive red eye seems to be at home here as it slowly, ominously, blinks.

		IkeSrfLanded = One of the samples has reacted very strangely to the surface of Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = One of the crystal samples explodes and throws green shards out of the materials bay!

		DresSrfLanded = As the samples process, the computer asks if it can sing you a song while it works. Apparently the song is about a flower of some kind.
		DresSrfLanded = One of the samples evaporates when exposed the environment.

		JoolInSpace = The computer gave an odd report no matter how many times we sent the request. Open the sample bay doors... "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't let you do that," was the only reply. The doors did open very promptly, however, when we opened the fusebox panel. Very curious.		
		JoolFlyingHigh = The intense, crushing pressure has drastically changed the composition of the materials. Super heating and ablation effects have been observed. The science bay is looking very disgruntled.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples burn, boil, or crumple under the extreme pressures and heat. The visual camera shows a wonderful rainbow of colors before it cuts out.
		JoolSrfLanded = You're not sure where the container stops and the samples start anymore...

		LaytheFlyingHigh = One of the samples burns on contact with the atmosphere. Interestingly, the color indicates the presence of oxygen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The sample smolders and pops as it burns up.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The fine, particulate sand of Laythe blows into the sample bay.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The sample bay power supply begins to short out! Electricity arcs and etches into the samples of the bay. It's quite the display!

		VallSrfLanded = Many of the samples either freeze or evaporate from the sample container.
		VallSrfLanded = The container sample door freezes up, before finally continuing to open. A thin coating forms on the surface of the samples.

		TyloSrfLanded = One of the samples shatters into a fine mist when exposed to the surface of Tylo.
		
		BopSrfLanded = The samples appear to be having a chemical reaction with the surface of Bop.
		BopSrfLanded = All of the liquid samples instantly evaporate.

		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples pit and melt when they come in contact with the surface of Pol!

		EelooSrfLanded = Some of the fine crystals lining Eeloo enter the materials bay. It also appears that some of the samples have become more conductive in the extreme cold.
