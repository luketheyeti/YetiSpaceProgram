	description = After selling enough fuel tanks and engines we started to get requests for a better way to control which way they're pointing. One of our engineers was working on a kinetic energy storage system based on large spinning rings so we stole that and turned it into an SAS module.
	// The Advanced Inline Stabilizer module containing a larger, heavier array of reaction wheels. These spin very quickly to create torque without wasting propellant. These larger wheels are driven by proportionally larger electric motors, so keep an eye on your Electricity levels.
